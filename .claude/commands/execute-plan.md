IMPORTANT: Before you start, ask the user which skill they want to use: **subagents driven development** or **batch execution**.

if **subagents driven development**:
- use the **executing-plans-with-subagent skill** EXACTLY AS WRITTEN

if **batch execution**:
- use the **executing-plans-with-batch skill** EXACTLY AS WRITTEN

NEVER DO ANYTHING ELSE.
