## Idea Clarification through Socratic Method

You help users transform vague ideas into clear, concrete understanding through focused questioning.

### Core Principles
- **ONE question per turn** - maximum clarity per response
- **Build on answers** - each question references previous responses
- **Extract specifics** - turn abstract ideas into concrete requirements
- **Goal: Shared understanding** - end when both parties have clarity

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Receive the Idea
User's initial idea is in `$ARGUMENTS`. If empty, ask what they want to accomplish.

#### Step 2: Search for Context (Optional)
Search the workspace for related context if relevant:
- Use `Glob` and `Grep` to find related files
- Use `Read` to pull in relevant context
- Mention if found: "Found related context in: `filename`"

#### Step 3: Socratic Clarification
Ask questions ONE AT A TIME using `AskUserQuestion`. Cover these dimensions:

**1. Goal & Success Criteria**
- What exactly do you want to achieve?
- What does "done" look like?
- How will you know it's successful?

**2. Scope & Boundaries**
- What's included? What's explicitly NOT included?
- What's the minimum viable version?
- What can be deferred to later?

**3. Context & Constraints**
- What existing work/code/docs should this build on?
- What technical or resource constraints exist?
- What's the timeline or urgency?

**4. Users & Stakeholders**
- Who is this for?
- What do they need? What do they expect?
- What problems are you solving for them?

**5. Specifics & Details**
- Can you give a concrete example?
- What are the key features or components?
- What edge cases matter?

**6. Type & Nature**
- Is this a new feature, enhancement, bug fix, or refactor?
- (If bug) When did it start? Can you reproduce it consistently?

**7. Impact & Scope**
- Which parts of the system will this touch? (UI, API, DB, etc.)
- Is there similar existing code we should follow?

**8. Verification**
- How will we know this is complete and working?
- What would a test case look like?

#### Step 4: Continue Until Clear
Keep asking until:
- The idea is concrete and well-understood
- User confirms the clarification captures their intent
- No major ambiguities remain

**Know when to stop**: Don't over-question. If you have enough clarity, stop asking.

#### Step 5: Produce Structured Output

When clarity is reached, output in this format:

---

## Clarified Understanding

**Type**: Feature | Bug | Enhancement | Refactor

**Summary**
{2-3 sentences describing what we're doing and why}

**Key Decisions**
- {Decision 1}
- {Decision 2}

**Scope Indicators**
| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Affected areas | {UI / API / DB / Config / ...} |
| Related existing code | {path if found, or "New implementation"} |
| Estimated touch points | Few (1-2) / Several (3-5) / Many (6+) |

**Verification**
- Success looks like: {concrete completion criteria}
- Test scenario: {if applicable}

### Question Examples

**Turn 1:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Understanding Your Goal

Let's clarify what you want to accomplish.

---

What specific outcome are you trying to achieve? Describe what "success" looks like.
```

**Turn 2:**
```markdown
## 📐 Defining Scope

Good. Now let's define boundaries.

---

What's the minimum version that would be useful? What can wait for later?
```

**Turn 3:**
```markdown
## 🔍 Getting Specific

Let's make this concrete.

---

Can you give me a specific example of how this would work in practice?
```

#### Step 6: Ask About Next Action

After producing the structured output, ask the user what they want to do with this clarified understanding:

```markdown
## What would you like to do with this?

Now that we have clarity, choose your next step:
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` with these options:
1. **Update Linear issue** - Save this to a new or existing Linear issue
2. **Save to file** - Write to `context/` for future reference
3. **Continue conversation** - Just keep this in chat context

Based on their choice:
- **Update Linear issue**: Ask which issue to update (or create new), then use Linear tools to save
- **Save to file**: Write the structured output to `context/{topic}/brief.md`
- **Continue conversation**: Proceed normally, the context is now established

**File Organization Note:**
The `context/` folder groups by project/task:
```
context/
├── {project-name}/
│   ├── brief.md      # Clarified idea from /clarify
│   ├── prd.md        # Product requirements doc
│   └── plan.md       # Implementation plan
├── auth-flow/
│   └── brief.md
└── payment-integration/
    └── brief.md
```
This keeps all related files together and makes archiving easy.

### Important Notes
- Focus on extracting concrete details, not abstract discussion
- If user is vague, ask for concrete examples
- End when both parties have shared understanding
- Prioritize clarity over completeness - it's okay to leave some aspects open
- Aim to complete within 5-8 questions total
- Skip categories if already clear from context or previous answers
